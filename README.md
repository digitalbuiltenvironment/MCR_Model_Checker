The MCR model checker is a Python code that would help IDD managers check for the compliance of Revit files against JTC's Model Content Requirement (MCR) requirements. This model checker serves to streamline and optimise the JTC MCR checking process. The code runs on the Revitpythonshell Add-In in Revit.
